- Generate future ideas


## Klaimzy Questions 🔎

Q1:

Hey Klaimzy, I want to understand if this claim is at risk of having a pre-existing condition.

Q2:

Where is the pet owner from? Give me some context to make my message more personal...


## Show Warning Flag ⚠️

- Pre-existing condition
- missing histories for specific dates
- mismatch internal info


## Key Considerations 💡

- Workflow is EVERYTHING. Maximum integration is the only way forward.
- Require integration with the backend (not difficult but subject to change).
- Some rules are subjective: better to provide nudges to champs rather than rules (for example, missing med history dates)
- Requires work from other departments
    - Data support from Data or Engineering
    - Considerable input from champs
    - Dictionaries
    - Specific conditions, etc


## Moving forward ⏩

Identify lowest hanging fruit:

- Requires minimal input from Ops.
- There is a natural & obvious progression to a more complete system.
- Requires minimal changes from FE team.
- We are confident in the stability of the internal data structures.
